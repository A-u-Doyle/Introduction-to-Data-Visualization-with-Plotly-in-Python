Fixing a Plotly figure
Examine the monthly_sales dictionary that has been printed in the console to determine what is missing.
Update the type inside the data element of monthly_sales to be a bar chart.
Update the text element of the title of the layout element to be 'Sales for Jan-Mar 2020'.
Create a figure using go.Figure() and the monthly_sales dictionary.

# Examine the printed dictionary

# Update the type
monthly_sales['data'][0]['type'] = 'bar'

# Update the title text
monthly_sales['layout']['title']['text'] = 'Sales for Jan-Mar 2020'

# Create a figure
fig = go.Figure(monthly_sales)

# Print it out!
fig.show()

Student scores bar graph
The school board has asked you to come and look at some test scores. They want an easy way to visualize the score of different students within a small class. This seems like a simple use case to practice your bar chart skills!

In this exercise, you will help the school board team by creating a bar chart of school test score values.

A DataFrame student_scores has been provided. In this and all future exercises where it is needed, plotly.express has already been loaded as px.

Instructions
100 XP
Examine the head of the provided student_scores DataFrame that has been printed for you to see what it contains.
Create a simple bar plot, setting the y-axis to be the score and the x-axis to be the student name.
Add a title to the plot: call it 'Student Scores by Student'.

# Create the bar plot
fig = px.bar(data_frame=student_scores, 
             x='student_name', 
             y='score', 
             title='Student Scores by Student')

# Show the plot
fig.show()
